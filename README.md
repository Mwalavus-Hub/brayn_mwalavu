<!-- About Section -->
## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I am a learner of the ALX <strong>Front-End Web Development</strong> program, and I'm in the process of revamping my GitHub Profile to make it stand out in my job search.

🌱 I started my journey in software engineering out of a desire to create tech-driven solutions that can make a real impact — just like I did in conservation.

🚀 What inspires me is the ability to turn ideas into tangible, interactive user experiences.

🎯 My aim is to become a full-stack developer who can contribute to impactful, user-centric web applications, especially in education, health, and community innovation.

🛠️ I would love to work on:
- Real-world client projects
- Mobile-first UI experiences
- Frontend integrations using APIs
- Tools for digital inclusion and social good

## 🎨 Fun Fact

Before tech, I helped reduce human-elephant conflict across Kenya. Now I’m solving bugs instead of chasing elephants 🐘➡🐛.
